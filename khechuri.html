	<h3>Masala Khichdi Ingredients</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><b>White rice:</b> I used sona masoori rice in this recipe. You may also use long-grain Basmati rice.</li>
		<li>Split green moong dal:  I used split green moong dal with husk (skin) in this recipe. I did not soak the dal. Split yellow moong also can be used.</li>
		<li>Mixed vegetables: I used onions, carrots, green peas, green beans, cauliflower, and spinach.</li>
		<li>Cumin seeds: cumin seeds are a must in any Indian dal tempering, so do not skip them.</li>
		<li>Ginger: Use freshly minced ginger for the best flavor. You can also use store-bought ginger paste if that's what you have in hand.</li>
		<li>Green chilies: I have used 2 Thai green chilies. However, you can skip it if you want to reduce the heat.</li>
		<li>Ghee: Khichdi tastes best with homemade ghee. However, if you are a vegan, replace it with cooking oil.</li>
		<li>Dry Spices: I have used turmeric powder, red chili powder, and coriander powder. You can increase or decrease the spices according to your choice.</li>
		<li>Coriander leaves: for garnish.</li>
