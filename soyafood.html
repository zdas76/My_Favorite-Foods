		<li>Fry the onion, garlic and ginger in half the oil on a medium-low heat until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes, half fill the tin with water and pour this in too. Turn up the heat to medium. Bring to a simmer and stir in all the spices with about 1 teaspoon of black pepper and a pinch of salt. Cook for 10-15 minutes until thickened.</li>
		<li>Meanwhile, heat the rest of the oil in a nonstick frying pan and fry the paneer cubes in batches until golden on all sides. Remove to a plate as they are ready.</li>
		<li>Tip the paneer into the sauce and simmer for 5-10 minutes to heat through while you warm the naans. Scatter over the coriander just before serving.</li>
